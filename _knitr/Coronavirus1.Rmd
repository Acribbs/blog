In every financial crisis in human history there have always been scientists who suffer and those who benefit, Coronavirus will be no exception. As scientists we are very good at adapting to new challenges and responding to new external research that may move your own research into a new direction. The magnitude of change seen in society within the last 8-10 weeks has been enormous and has forced many scientists to take a good long hard look at their current careers and their future.

I have been unlucky enough to have seen two major world financial crashes during my scientific career. I began my PhD in 2008/2009, just as the first financial crash was starting to take hold. Despite the world going through an incredibly tough time, I was largely protected during that crisis because of my regular student stipend. The financial implications of this crisis on science were seen gradually over many years. This gave scientists a sufficient length of time to react and make decisions about their scientific research. While financial crashes are challenging for all, the relative slow pace of the crash allowed academic scientists to make informed decisions about their career choices. As a consequence, I saw many friends and colleagues leave academic science to persue careers in industry (Im not saying this is a bad thing. The brain drain was only bad for academia). Industry was seen as more stable than academia because funding decisions are usually made over a >5 year cycle and therefore more attractive.

That was then. Fast forward to the current Corona crisis and the financial situation this time around seems incredibly different. I am luck that I have a contract that extends until after 2021 so I am personally not acutely affected by the short term effects of this crisis. However, this will undoutedly have an effect on my future career in science, as it will on all scientists. This is because I am required to attract scientific funding to support my research. As an early career scientist, this year I have been working incredibly hard to move my scientific career forwards. Specifically, trying to attract grant funding so that I can move towards "scientific independence". 

For those who dont know, basic scientific research is largely supported by charities. These charities include the likes of major players such as the Cancer Research UK, The British Heart Foundation and Wellcome, in addition to smaller charities such as the Bone Cancer Research Trust and Brain Tumour Charity, just to name a few. The income for these charities is largely from donations, event fundraising activities and income from endownments. If you look at the financial income from the CRUK in 2017/2018 you can see that the majority of fuinding is from donations, events and trading, all of which have been reduced with the current crisis.

## The short term implications of Coronavirus

This has meant that CRUK has had to cut back on its current financial commitments just to stay afloat. The impact of the Coronavirus crisis was immediate, within 3 weeks of the government initiating lockdown I recieved two emails from the CRUK stating that the two pending grants have had their decisions deferred until September. The email came with the caveat that the CRUK will need to re-evaluate its financial position in the future. This wasnt a shock to me because I was expecting that the Coronavirus would have some financial imoplications for charities, but what did shock me was the speed at which they reacted. I naively though that it would follow a slow predictable wind down of their activitied like the last financial crisis. However, it seems charierties were more acutely affected by this crisis than others because their income stream was cut dead by lockdown.

The main problem that the charities funding scientific research have had to deal with is warp speed this crisis has occurred at. The financial crash didnt happen over a period of months (like in 2008) it happened over a period of 23-24 days. This is unprecidented in every sense of the word. The immediate effect of this cliff edge crash and the resulting world wide lockdown has meant that charities have their income streams slashed. This has obviously had a considerable knockon effect on scientists who are now considering how they best support their research groups. 

## The long term implications of Coronavirus

Because of the unprecidented nature of this crisis, the long term effects are very difficult to predict, but I would like to provide a personal opinion on what is likely to change over the next few months/years decades. Firstly, some hope, scientific progress is always faster in a time of crisis. For example, look at the speed at which technological improvements were made during world war II and the cold war.  Crises can then also be moments for us to reinvent ourselves and our scientific outputs. 

### Research funding

I said at the beginning of this post that crisis creates suffering and benefit. Those that benefit or suffer is likely going to be dictated by what scientific funding will look like in the future. 

Funding that is likely to be reduced will be that focused on non-infectious diseases such as cancer, heart disease and autoimmunity. Given that the financial recovery is likely to take a long time, this funding reduction is possibly going to be long term too. Charities will also need to cover their losses of the Coronavirus. However, if the Governments decide to support the charities that fund this type of research then the impact is likely to be reduced. 

I predict that research on technology, machine learning and infectious diseases is likely to be the beneficiary from this crisis. This is mainly because technological advances have always been seen as ways out of a crisis as they promote both health and societal benefits (Manufacturing, jobs e.c.t). Increased research on infections disease is obvious going to be a priority for all governments in the near future.  Governemts will now be looking for science to deliver the new medicines and vaccines to prevent any future pandemic. 

### Private equity research funding

The crash of stock market will likely bolster the number of people investing in private equity. At the moment this private equity has ground to a stand still and all money currently invested is going to support their current investments. However, in the medium term this is likely to reverse as more investors move away from the stock market to private equity as this form of invesment is seen as very successful for investors. The effect of this is that there may be more private equity to support University spinout companies, particularly if these companies are focused on Coronavirus or other infectious diseases. 

### Brain drain?

It is likely academia will also suffer a brain drain towards industry that will now look to be more secure than academia. Even before the pandemic a lot of my colleagues had left, were considering or were in the process of leaving academia because of the poor working environment and lack of job security (See these two studies for more info on the mood of researchers in academia. [S.Acton 2019](https://elifesciences.org/articles/46827) and [E Loissel 2019](https://elifesciences.org/articles/52881)). In order to stem this potential brain drain we need to start to think of practical ways in which we can support scientisis over a longer term. Im not just talking about all staff, all the way from Research Assistants to Principle Investigators. The reliance of academia on short term contracts has been a significant factor for many of my friends leaving the university. This and other issues need to be addressed. The wellcome trust gave me some hope for chance this year when they initiated the [Cafe Culture](https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/research-culture/hosting-your-cafe-culture-discussion) to discuss some of the issues. We were going to host one of these within our research institute, until Coronavirus got in the way.

## How can we mitigate some of these challenges?

Firstly, we need to suport our colleagues and look out for the people that work for us. I have gone into survival mode, not for myself, but for the people who I work with. I have spent the past few weeks writing research grants and fellowships to suport members of my group, particularly those who are nearing the end of their contracts. However, my time is scarece, the funding opportunities are even more scarecer, plus grants are likely to be the most competitive they have every been. Plus being at an early career puts me at a disadvantage when going against more established and senior scientists. However, my aim is to stay positive and focus on what I can do in this moment. Thats work hard and continue to apply for grants, despite the hurdles.

Recently, myself and colleagues at the University of Oxford have developed novel single-cell sequencing technologies that we had planned to develop at pace during the next few months, leading into next year. The Coronavirus has allowed us to refocus our efforts towards re-tailoring our technology towards the current coronavirus pandemic. There seems to be plenty of Coronavirus specific funding opportunities listed on the [Science buisiness](https://sciencebusiness.net/coronavirus-funding-opportunities) website. Science has always followed the trends, whether this has been for the better or for worse has always been hotly debated. Therefore we are following the current scientific trend by applying to some of these funds. We can see an oppotunity to develop a novel clinical tool that may help eliviate this or future Coronavirus pandemics and in turn it may help to support my colleagues and staff. 

## Final words

The Coronavirus epidemic has shown us how fragile the world is, but it has also shown us what is important in life. We have seen some amazing displays of positive humanity during this crisis (For example, see the note someone left on the bins next to my street) and collectively we can overcome this virus. This crisis will pass and it will likely lead to significant changes in the way we do science. If we can adapt to the new scientific and funding challenges then we will have a better chance of succeding in mitigating some of the long term negative consequences of the pandemic.
